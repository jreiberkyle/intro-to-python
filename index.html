## A Tale of 2 Parts

#### Part 1: The Basics

 - Python Language
 - Hello, World!
 - Programming Basics

#### Part 2: Advanced Control

---

## Python Language
###What Is Python

 - Python is a programming language
 - What is a programming language?
 - Why do we need one?

---

### Your computer speaks another language
![binary code](./images/binary-503577_640.jpg)

---

## Why python is great

 - **Easy to use:** It is closer to human language than to machine language.
 - **Powerful:** It’s used in academic research, Google, NASA, and Planet Labs
 - **Runs Everywhere:** It’s platform independent. You can write your
program on a Mac and run it on Windows.
 - **Free and Open Source.**
 - **Great Community.**

---

## Hello, World!

 ```python
print "Hello, world!"
 ```

- Python Shell
- Text Editor / Python Interpreter
- Online Interpreter

---

## Python Shell

- Open terminal (cmd-Space)
- Type `python`

```
Python 2.7.8 (default, Oct 15 2014, 22:04:42) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.1 (clang-503.0.40)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

 - `$` means you are in the terminal (not python)
 - `>>>` means you are in python
 - To leave intepreter, type `exit()` 

---

## Text Editor / Python Interpreter

**Text Editor**: A program that opens text files and allows the user to edit and save them.

(Different than a word processor)

- **Built in**: vi
- **3rd Party:** MacVim, Atom.io, Sublime Text, Notepad++, Brackets ...
- **My Favorite:** Sublime (lots of plugins, fuzzy search)

---

## vi

- 
 - Open terminal (cmd-Space)
 - Type `vi helloworld.py`
 - Enter insert mode (i)
 - Add command
 - Exit insert mode (ESC)
 - Save (:wq)
 - Type `python helloworld.py`

---

## Online Interpreter

- [repl.it](http://repl.it/languages/Python): (http://repl.it/languages/Python)
 - right pane: Interactive
 - left pane: Text editor (run using arrow)

# Programming Basics

- Math
- Types
- Built-in Functions
- Variables
- I/O
- Conditional Logic

---

Learning to Code is as Simple as ABC
#Always
#Be
#Coding

---

## Math

Python is good at math

```
>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> 2 - 3
-1
>>> (345 + 3) * 9
3132
```

---

## Math Operators

 - ``+`` Addition
 - ``–`` Subtraction
 - ``*`` Multiplication
 - ``/`` Division

---

##Exercise
Try some math

 - Does Python follow order of operation rules?
 - Did division return the whole result?

---

We can use more than just numbers

```
>>> "Buenos" + " dias"
'Buenos dias'
>>> 'or I can use single quotes'
'or I can use single quotes'
```

---

But what if we combine text and numbers?

```
>>> "I'll see you at " + 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str'
and 'int' objects
```

---

## Types
 - Python is extremely picky and needs to classify everything before it
knows what to do with it
 - `“I’ll see you at “` is a String
 - `2` is an Integer
 - Use the `type()` function to tell what type an object is

---

## Exercise
What is the result of the following:

 - `type("Iowa Tech Chicks")`
 - `type(6)`
 - `type(6.1)`
 - `type(6.0)`

---

## Type casting 
```
>>> "I'll see you at " + str(2)
"I'll see you at 2"
>>> 1 + int("2")
3
```

---

## Built-in Functions

 - What if you want to do something more complex than addition,
subtraction, etc?
 - Python gives us functions to do more complex operations
 - Functions act on specific types

---

## Number Functions

- `abs(n)`
- `pow(n, e)`

```
>>> abs(-7)

>>> pow(2, 8)
```

Hint: to figure out what a function does use the help function (e.g. `help(abs)`)

---

## String Methods
Functions specific to the string object

The string is the first argument

- `.capitalize()`
- `.replace()`
- `.lower()`


```
>>> "iowa".capitalize()

>>> "Iowa Tech Chicks".replace("Chicks","Peeps")

>>> "MOAR PYTHON!!!".lower()
```

---

## Exercise
Try the following String methods

- `title`
- `strip`
- `index`
- `split`

Hint: to figure out what amethod does use the help function (e.g. `help("f".strip`)

---

But functions only work on certain types
```
>>> pow("elephant", "brain")
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(
s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'str'
```

---

## Variables
Keeping your code **DRY**

**D**on’t **R**epeat **Y**ourself

```
>>> password =
"SuperSecure"
>>> password
'SuperSecure'
>>> num1 = 4
>>> num1
4
>>> num2 = 1234.5
>>> num2
1234.5
```

---

## Why variables are useful

- Variable means “liable to change”
- Variables change throughout the lifetime of our program
- Without variables our programs wouldn’t be able to change
- Setting a fixed value in a program is called ‘hard coding’

---

## Exercise

Let’s throw a party

```
>>> party_budget = 1000
>>> angel_round = 100000
>>> party_budget + angel_round
101000
```

What is your party budget now?

---

```
>>> party_budget
1000
```

We have to tell the party_budget it has a new value

```
>>> party_budget = party_budget + angel_round
>>> party_budget
101000
```

---

The guestlist

```
>>> guestlist = "Peter June Shreek"
>>> guestlist = guestlist + " Roberto"
>>> guestlist
'Peter June Shreek Roberto'
```

---

Anything you can do to a ‘literal’ you can do
to a variable
```
>>> startup = "my elephant brain"
>>> startup.title()
'My Elephant Brain'
>>> revenue = -429376
>>> abs(revenue)
429376
>>> revenue + 1000000
570624
```

---

But did the variable change?
```
>>> startup
'my elephant brain'
```

The function returned a new value, it did not change the original value.

---

## Exercise
- Try using the math operators we saw earlier on variables
- `abs(n)`
- `pow(n, x)`

---

## Comments

- Python ignores anything after the # character

```
# This is a comment
print 'Hello World' # so is this
# print("this won't be printed")
```

---

## I/O - Asking for Input

`raw_input()` (`input()` in Python3)
```
#raw input prompts the user 
raw_input("Please enter your name:\n")
#store the result in a variable
my_name = raw_input("Please enter your name:\n")
#store the result in a variable
my_age = int(raw_input("How old are you?\n"))
```

---

## I/O - Printing

```
>>> party_budget = 1500
>>> print party_budget
```

---

## Special Characters

- `\n`
- `\`
- `\’`
- `\\`
- `\t` 

```
>>> print "215 Spadina \nToronto \nOntario"
215 Spadina 
Toronto 
Ontario
```

---

## String formatting

String Format method
```
>>> utensil =
"spoon"
>>> "My {} is too big".format(utensil)
'My spoon is too big'
>>> "The {0} came before the {1}".format('chicken', 'egg')
'The chicken came before the egg'
>>> "The {1} came before the {0}".format('chicken', 'egg')
'The egg came before the chicken'
>>> template = "The Jaguar F-Type has {}hp"
>>> template.format(488)
'The Jaguar F-Type has 488hp'
```

---

## Exercises
- Use multiple placeholders but only one argument
- Round Pi to 3 decimals
- Print centered text
 - ' centered '
- Print centered text and pad with plus signs
 - '+++++++++++centered+++++++++++'
- Look at http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings
for help

---

## Recap

- Programs
 - Programming languages are intermediates between computer and
human language
 - Programs are sets of instructions
- Languages have ‘types’: string, integer, float, ...
- Built-in Functions
 - add behaviour
 - most work on only one type

---

## Recap

- Variables
 - save us from repeating ourselves
 - don’t change until you tell them to
 - Anything you can do to a literal you can do to a variable
- I/O
 - input: use raw_input() / input()
 - output: use print() and format()

---

## Exercise
### A Ticket App
Peter’s Python Prognostications

- Here’s how it works
 1. We start with 8 tickets
 2. We ask the user how many they want
 3. We print out that number
 4. We show the user how many tickets are left

---

- Start with 8 tickets
- Ask the user how many they want
- Print out that number
- Show the user how many tickets are left

```
num_tickets = 8

tickets_requested = # ask the user how many tickets she wants

print "You've asked for {} ticket(s)".format(tickets_requested)
# deduct the tickets sold from available tickets
print #the number of remaining tickets
```

###SAVE FOR LATER

---

###Issues you may have had

- raw_input always returns a string
 - You’ll need to cast it to an int
- Did you forget to close a quotation mark?
 - It happens to the best of us
- num_tickets wasn’t updated
 - You have to explicitly update the number
 - This is called tracking ‘state’

---

## Conditional Logic


- Programs don’t run line by line from start to end
- They jump around according to rules
- One way to specify those rules is to use conditions

---

## Conditional Logic

- We frequently want to test if two values are equal
- For equality we use the double equal sign
- ``1==1``
- We can test if two things aren’t equal with ``!=``
- ``1!=2``
- There are also many of the math operators we know
- Greater than: ``>``
- Greater than or equal to: ``>=``
- Less than: ``<``
- Less than or equal to: ``<=``

---

## Exercise
- In the Python shell use all the operators on the previous slide

---

## Boolean types

- Either true or false
- Useful when making a decision

---

if statement
```
if 1==1:
	print "I am the walrus!"
```

---

else Statement
```
if 0:
	print "0 is always false"
else:
	print "So the else clause is executed"
```

---

elif statement
```

today = "Saturday"
if today == "Friday":
	print "Everybody’s working for the weekend!"
elif today == "Saturday":
	print "S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y Night!"
elif today == "Sunday":
	print "Pancakes."
else:
	print "Early to bed and early to rise."
```

---

## Exercise
### A Ticketing App (cont.)
Stop the user from buying tickets if they ask for more than are
available

---

## Exercise
###Color
Write a program that asks you what your favourite color is and tells
you something else that is the same color
```
What is your favourite color?
Green
I like turtles
```

---

## Color

```
fav = raw_input('What is your favourite color?\n')
fav_lower = fav.lower()
if fav_lower == 'green':
    print 'I like turtles'
elif fav_lower == 'blue':
    print 'Like the sky'
elif fav_lower == 'purple':
    print 'My favourite ice cream when I was young was called Purple People Eater'
else:
    print "{} is my favourite too.".format(fav)
```

---

## Exercise
###And/Or
- Write a program that prints a string if the input is less than 10 or
greater than 20
- Do the same thing for greater than 10 and less than 20

---

###and/or
```
input = raw_input("Give me a number: ")
input = int(input)
if input < 10 or input > 20:
    print 'That\'s a good number'
if input > 10 and input < 20:
    print "You've found the sweet spot"
```

---
