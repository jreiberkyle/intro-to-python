## Math

Python is good at math

```
>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> 2 - 3
-1
>>> (345 + 3) * 9
3132
```

--

## Math Operators

 - ``+`` Addition
 - ``–`` Subtraction
 - ``*`` Multiplication
 - ``/`` Division

--

##Exercise
Try some math

 - Does Python follow order of operation rules?
 - Did division return the whole result?

--

We can use more than just numbers

```
>>> "Buenos" + " dias"
'Buenos dias'
>>> 'or I can use single quotes'
'or I can use single quotes'
```

--

But what if we combine text and numbers?

```
>>> "I'll see you at " + 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str'
and 'int' objects
```
					</script>

                <section id="types" data-markdown data-separator="^\n---\n$" data-separator-vertical="^\n--\n$">
                    <script type="text/template">

## Types
 - Python is extremely picky and needs to classify everything before it
knows what to do with it
 - `“I’ll see you at “` is a String
 - `2` is an Integer
 - Use the `type()` function to tell what type an object is

--

## Exercise
What is the result of the following:

 - `type("Iowa Tech Chicks")`
 - `type(6)`
 - `type(6.1)`
 - `type(6.0)`

--

## Type casting 
```
>>> "I'll see you at " + str(2)
"I'll see you at 2"
>>> 1 + int("2")
3
```
					</script>
				</section>
                <section id="functions" data-markdown data-separator="^\n---\n$" data-separator-vertical="^\n--\n$">
                    <script type="text/template">
## Functions

 - What if you want to do something more complex than addition,
subtraction, etc?
 - Python gives us functions to do more complex operations
 - Functions act on specific types

--

## Number Functions

- `abs(n)`
- `pow(n, e)`

```
>>> abs(-7)

>>> pow(2, 8)
```

Hint: to figure out what a function does use the help function (e.g. `help(abs)`)

--

## String Methods
Functions specific to the string object

The string is the first argument

- `.capitalize()`
- `.replace()`
- `.lower()`


```
>>> "iowa".capitalize()

>>> "Iowa Tech Chicks".replace("Chicks","Peeps")

>>> "MOAR PYTHON!!!".lower()
```

--

## Exercise
Try the following String methods

- `title`
- `strip`
- `index`
- `split`

Hint: to figure out what amethod does use the help function (e.g. `help("f".strip`)

--

But functions only work on certain types
```
>>> pow("elephant", "brain")
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(
s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'str'
```

					</script>
				</section>
                <section id="variables" data-markdown data-separator="^\n---\n$" data-separator-vertical="^\n--\n$">
                    <script type="text/template">

## Variables
Keeping your code **DRY**

**D**on’t **R**epeat **Y**ourself

```
>>> password =
"SuperSecure"
>>> password
'SuperSecure'
>>> num1 = 4
>>> num1
4
>>> num2 = 1234.5
>>> num2
1234.5
```

--

## Why variables are useful

- Variable means “liable to change”
- Variables change throughout the lifetime of our program
- Without variables our programs wouldn’t be able to change
- Setting a fixed value in a program is called ‘hard coding’

--

## Exercise

Let’s throw a party

```
>>> party_budget = 1000
>>> angel_round = 100000
>>> party_budget + angel_round
101000
```

What is your party budget now?

--

```
>>> party_budget
1000
```

We have to tell the party_budget it has a new value

```
>>> party_budget = party_budget + angel_round
>>> party_budget
101000
```

--

The guestlist

```
>>> guestlist = "Peter June Shreek"
>>> guestlist = guestlist + " Roberto"
>>> guestlist
'Peter June Shreek Roberto'
```

--

Anything you can do to a ‘literal’ you can do
to a variable
```
>>> startup = "my elephant brain"
>>> startup.title()
'My Elephant Brain'
>>> revenue = -429376
>>> abs(revenue)
429376
>>> revenue + 1000000
570624
```

--

But did the variable change?
```
>>> startup
'my elephant brain'
```

The function returned a new value, it did not change the original value.

--

## Exercise
- Try using the math operators we saw earlier on variables
- `abs(n)`
- `pow(n, x)`

                    <script type="text/template">

## I/O - Asking for Input

```
#raw input prompts the user
raw_input("Please enter your name:\n")
#store the result in a variable
my_name = raw_input("Please enter your name:\n")
#store the result in a variable
my_age = int(raw_input("How old are you?\n"))
```

--

## I/O - Printing

```
>>> party_budget = 1500
>>> print party_budget
```

--

## Special Characters

- \n
- \
- \’
- \\
- \t 

```
>>> print "215 Spadina \nToronto \nOntario"
215 Spadina 
Toronto 
Ontario
```

--

## String formatting

String Format method
```
>>> utensil =
"spoon"
>>> "My {} is too big".format(utensil)
'My spoon is too big'
>>> "The {0} came before the {1}".format('chicken', 'egg')
'The chicken came before the egg'
>>> "The {1} came before the {0}".format('chicken', 'egg')
'The egg came before the chicken'
>>> template = "The Jaguar F-Type has {}hp"
>>> template.format(488)
'The Jaguar F-Type has 488hp'
```

--

## Exercises
- Use multiple placeholders but only one argument
- Round Pi to 3 decimals
- Print centered text
 - ' centered '
- Print centered text and pad with plus signs
 - '+++++++++++centered+++++++++++'
- Look at http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings
for help

## Recap

- Programs
 - Programming languages are intermediates between computer and
human language
 - Programs are sets of instructions
- Languages have ‘types’: string, integer, float, ...
- Functions
 - add behaviour
 - most work on only one type
- Variables
 - save us from repeating ourselves
 - don’t change until you tell them to
 - Anything you can do to a literal you can do to a variable

## Comments
- Python ignores anything after the # character

# This is a comment
print 'Hello World' # so is this
# print("this won't be printed")

## Exercise
### A Ticket App
Peter’s Python Prognostications

- Here’s how it works
 1. We start with 8 tickets
 2. We ask the user how many they want
 3. We print out that number
 4. We show the user how many tickets are left

--

tickets_begin.py
```
num_tickets = 8

tickets_requested = # ask the user how many tickets she wants

print "You've asked for {} ticket(s)".format(tickets_requested)
# deduct the tickets sold from available tickets
print #the number of remaining tickets
```

--

Issues you may have had

- raw_input always returns a string
 - You’ll need to cast it to an int
- Did you forget to close a quotation mark?
 - It happens to the best of us
- num_tickets wasn’t updated
 - You have to explicitly update the number
 - This is called tracking ‘state’

					</script>

                <section id="conditional" data-markdown data-separator="^\n---\n$" data-separator-vertical="^\n--\n$">
                    <script type="text/template">

## Conditional Logic


- Programs don’t run line by line from start to end
- They jump around according to rules
- One way to specify those rules is to use conditions

--

## Conditional Logic

- We frequently want to test if two values are equal
- For equality we use the double equal sign
- ``1==1``
- We can test if two things aren’t equal with ``!=``
- ``1!=2``
- There are also many of the math operators we know
- Greater than: ``>``
- Greater than or equal to: ``>=``
- Less than: ``<``
- Less than or equal to: ``<=``

--

## Exercise
- In the Python shell use all the operators on the previous slide

--

## Boolean types

- Either true or false
- Useful when making a decision

--

if statement
```
if 1==1:
	print "I am the walrus!"
```

--

else Statement
```
if 0:
	print "0 is always false"
else:
	print "So the else clause is executed"
```

--

elif statement
```

today = "Saturday"
if today == "Friday":
	print "Everybody’s working for the weekend!"
elif today == "Saturday":
	print "S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y Night!"
elif today == "Sunday":
	print "Pancakes."
else:
	print "Early to bed and early to rise."
```

## Exercise
### A Ticketing App
Stop the user from buying tickets if they ask for more than are
available

## Exercise
###Color
Write a program that asks you what your favourite color is and tells
you something else that is the same color
```
What is your favourite color?
Green
I like turtles
```

--

## Color

```
fav = raw_input('What is your favourite color?\n')
fav_lower = fav.lower()
if fav_lower == 'green':
print 'I like turtles'
elif fav_lower == 'blue':
print 'Like the sky'
elif fav_lower == 'purple':
print 'My favourite ice cream when I was young was called Purple People Eater'
else:
print "{} is my favourite too.".format(fav)

## Exercise
###And/Or
- Write a program that prints a string if the input is less than 10 or
greater than 20
- Do the same thing for greater than 10 and less than 20

--

###and/or
```
input = raw_input("Give me a number: ")
input = int(input)
if input < 10 or input > 20:
print 'That\'s a good number'
if input > 10 and input < 20:

                <section id="loops" data-markdown data-separator="^\n---\n$" data-separator-vertical="^\n--\n$">
                    <script type="text/template">
## Loops

- So far our code has run from top to bottom
- Programs usually need to do something over and over agin
- Computers don’t mind doing repetitive tasks

--

## While Loop
```
#"while" something is true
#perform an action
while True:
	print 'yep'
	ret = raw_input('continue? (y/n)')
	if 'y' == ret:
		break
```

--

code within the loop may invalidate the condition
```
loop = True
while loop:
	print 'Are we there yet?'
	loop = False
print 'Done the loop'
```

--

To run a certain number of times we test a
variable and increment within the loop
```
x = 1
while x < 10:
	print x
	x += 1
```

--

## Exercise

Print from 10 to 1

--

## Excercise (for later)

Guided Exercise

- We’re going to write a game for the computer
- The computer will pick a number and we have to guess it
```
from random import rand
int x = randint(1,10)
```
- The user should know if they are too high or too low
- We know how to ask for input
- We know how to compare guesses
- We want to give the user multiple chances

					</script>

                <section id="data-structures" data-markdown data-separator="^\n---\n$" data-separator-vertical="^\n--\n$">
                    <script type="text/template">
## Lists
- Lists are lists
- That was useless
- But seriously, they’re just a set of objects
- Lists can hold strings, integers, floats, booleans, and anything else you
can create

--

## Creating Lists
```
mylist = [1,2,3,4]
print mylist #[1, 2, 3, 4]
companies = ['My Elephant Brain', 're:3D', 'Hacker You']
print companies
#['My Elephant Brain', 're:3D', 'Hacker You']
kitchen_sink = [1 , 'a', True]
print kitchen_sink
#[1, 'a', True]
```

--

## Accessing Items in a List

```
>>> companies[1]
're:3D'
>>> companies[-1]
'Hacker You'
>>> companies[10]
Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>",
line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```

--

## Exercise
- Using a list and a while loop, print the days of the week
- ‘break’ the loop on Wednesday

--

Modifying a List
```
#add and item
l.append(5)
print l
#remove and item
l.remove(3)
print l
# remove throws an error if the item does not exist
l.remove(9)
```

--


## A Quick jump Back to Loops
```
# for loops make it easy to loop over a list
for company in companies:
print company
# they are also useful for looping
# a known number of times
for i in range(1,10):
	print i
```
--

## Exercise

- Use a for loop to print the days of the week
- Use a for loop to count from 10 to 1
 - Hint: by default `range()` increases by 1 each time, but you can give it a third
argument to tell it the number to increment by each time
 - e.g. `range(0, 10, 2)`

# Hangman

- Let's make a hangman game using what we learned today.
- But before you start coding away, it helps to think about what you're
trying to do.
- Remember, computers need specific instructions, so you need to
break it down.
- You can start by playing hangman on paper with each other.
- Start with [hangman_draft.py](./examples/hangman_draft.py)

### You’re programmers now!
- Sure there’s more to know
- There’s always more to know
- The trick is using what you know

# Functions
We put reusable code inside 'functions'

functions.py
```
def add_two(a, b):
return a + b
ans = add_two(1, 2)
print ans
```
--

Exercise

Write functions to do the following

- Multiply two numbers
- Combine an int and a string
- Print the sequence of a given number, down to zero
 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0

--

# Modules
Python code is reusable by other code
start python in the same folder as functions.py
```
from functions import add_two
print add_two(1,2)
```
